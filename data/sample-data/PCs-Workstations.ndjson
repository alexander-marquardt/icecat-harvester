Equipped with the with the all new 2010 Intel® Core™ vPro processor family, this PCs, made of environmentally-conscious material, operate reliably and quietly. Furthermore, these devices equipped with high efficient power supplies (up to 89%) meet today's ENERGY STAR® 5.0 criteria and features the world’s first 0-Watt technology (optional). Why compromise between a good conscience and top-quality equipment when you can have both at the same time? SPECIAL FEATURES -The all new 2010 Intel® Core™ vPro Processor Family. -genuine Windows® 7 Professional. -Flexible desktop solution – less than 13 liters volume. -Green PC. -Halogen-free mainboard. -Latest Intel® Q75 chipset. -Up to 89 % energy efficient power supply. GREEN IT Fujitsu is committed to eliminating the use of harmful and potentially harmful substances in its products and production processes in order to minimize risk to end users and to the environment. This strategy is captured in Environmental Guideline FTS03230 and forms the basis on which all Fujitsu's products are designed. Especially for ESPRIMO PCs this means that all used printed circuit boards are halogen free. Furthermore they are compliant with several certificates awarding environmental conscience such as Blue Angel, Nordic Star, ENERGY STAR® and EPEAT. ENERGY EFFICIENCY As energy saving is one of the core components of Fujitsu’ approach to the environment, we permanently try to improve the energy efficiency of our products. The ESPRIMO E features latest technology regarding Intel® chipset and processor and optional an up to 89% energy efficient power supply. Furthermore it delivers enhanced power management settings and optional 0-Watt power consumption in off- / hibernating mode. THE ALL NEW INTEL TECHNOLOGY Equipped with the newest Intel technology, Fujitsu’s PCs offer intelligent performance and are easy to manage and configure. Intel’s Hyper-threading Technology allows each processor core to work on two tasks at the same time while Intel’s Turbo Boost Technology automatically speeds up the processor when the user’s workload requires extra performance. Sophisticated new management technology allows businesses to easily maintain even unresponsive computers with tools such as remote configuration, diagnosis, isolation, and repair. MANAGEABILITY Maximum system security and manageability are of critical importance to IT managers. With the Intel vPro Technology and the integrated Intel Active Management Technology (iAMT), Intel is seeking to improve these levels still further, in the deskbound and notebook sector.
