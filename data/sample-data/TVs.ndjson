{"id": "19877971", "title": "Sony KDL-65W855A", "brand": "Sony", "description": "Sony KDL-65W855A\n\n\nBring colour and sound to life A picture as real as life itself: So realistic you might just forget you're watching TV. Stunning images are produced using our most advanced X-Reality™ PRO picture engine that brings individual details to life. Night scenes are especially spectacular with beautiful blacks and stark contrast from the local dimming LED lighting. And the Quartz-cut design brings a new edge to TV with a hint of translucent colour that emphasizes the hidden gem within. The TRILUMINOS Display presents more colours, more brilliantly than ever before. Reds, greens and blues shine with more depth and realism than conventional white LED displays. Ultra-clear, realistic motion comes courtesy of Motionflow™ XR.. Pro-grade picture detail: Introducing a picture so lifelike, it's like looking through a window. Sunsets appear with natural colour transitions and each scene in everything you watch shows crisp, clear detail. HD movies, sports, even YouTube clips and home movies burst off the screen with astonishing detail and colour. Sony's X-Reality PRO picture engine draws on its extensive reality database to display our most lifelike picture yet.. More brilliant colour than ever before: Spoil yourself with the widest colour spectrum we've ever offered on a television. Unique to Sony, TRILUMINOS Display technology creates incredibly true, natural shades of colours – just the way you want them. Hard-to-reproduce reds, aqua blues and emerald greens are displayed beautifully, so landscapes and seascapes look more vivid. Faces look better too, with natural skin tones. It's all thanks to a new generation TV technology that gives images a heightened sense of depth.. The difference is dynamic: It's all about perfecting a natural look. Dynamic Edge LED backlighting with local dimming delivers pitch-black night scenes and illuminates bright scenes. Rather than illuminating the entire screen, contrast is boosted in just the right areas for a more realistic picture.. Astonishing clarity: When you watch a kickoff at the stadium, the ball doesn't blur from left to right. Recreating natural motion with reduced judder and less blur, Motionflow™ XR helps you see each end-over-end rotation of the ball by taking motion clarity beyond refresh rates, for up to quadruple the motion effect—so you see everything as clearly as if you were in the stands.. Sound that’s all around you: Whether you're watching movies, live concerts, drama or sports – fill the room rich, dynamic sound. Find yourself pulled into the heart of the action with a finely detailed virtual 5.1-channel soundstage backed by Sony's exclusive S-Force Front Surround technology. An enlarged sweet spot lets everyone enjoy optimum sound wherever they're sitting, even if it's not directly in front of the TV.. Your smartphone, now on TV: Broadcast hilarious YouTube clips, blockbuster hits, the hottest apps and more from your smartphone onto your TV big enough for everyone to enjoy. Wirelessly connect Miracast™ or NFC enabled smartphones with ease2,6 or connect via MHL cable – whatever's on your smartphone's screen will be resized to appear with eye-pleasing clarity. And when you connect via MHL cable, not only can you control the interface with your TV remote, but your smartphone will keep charging the whole time5.. Way beyond cable with built-in Wi-Fi: Wirelessly stream beautiful, HD entertainment straight from the Internet or your home network using built-in Wi-Fi® connectivity. Open the door to the endless entertainment of the Sony Entertainment Network, where thousands of movies, TV shows, online videos, games and music are always on tap. By connecting to the Internet you can access Full HD 1080p entertainment, 3D content and made-for-TV apps like Netflix®, Pandora®, YouTube™, Facebook® and more. *Note: depends on region..
